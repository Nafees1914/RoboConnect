# RoboConnect
The extension uses content scripts to interact with LinkedIn's page. It finds all "Connect" buttons on the page, waits for a random amount of time (between 5-10 seconds), and then clicks them. It automatically skips over the "Message" buttons. The connection requests are sent without the user needing to manually click each button.
